## Credits

This code was first developed and maintained by [Jason Grimes](https://github.com/jasongrimes).

Since this module did not seemed to be maintained anymore, i decided to fork it and will try to maintain this release.

After i forked this project, i discovered that another person made some significant changes into 
the Silex\OAuth2ServiceProvider.php file. I integrated his changes into this version.
So i also thank [Adam Lombalto] (https://github.com/adanlobato) for his code.
